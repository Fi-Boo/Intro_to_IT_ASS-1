                <p>It was a dreary morning, the mist lay so heavily on the jungle floor that visibility beyond a few meters was impossible. The peaceful silence was broken by the muffled breathing of two shadows stealthily rushing through the foliage. Their destination, a small fishing boat anchored on a sandbank just off shore.<br> 
                <p>Once aboard, the couple were shuttled into the rear cabin alongside numerous other villagers. As the boatman raised anchor and pushed off, all eyes were plastered to the beach line, watching out for the telltale signs that their escape attempt had been discovered. </p>
                <p>Only once the beach had vanished behind the wall of impenetrable mist were they able to relax. At this point the young lady loosened her grip on a small bundle held firmly against her chest. Looking down she pulled back a corner of the wrapping cloth to reveal the face of a 16 day old infant.</p>

                <p>My name is Phi and I was that infant. Having escaped a war torn Vietnam, my family of four were granted citizenship and settled in Richmond, Victoria. </p> 
                <p>Growing up in a traditional Vietnamese Catholic household was tough. Studying was ingrained into me from a young age with a plethora of after school academic activities like piano, english, mathematics and choir. 
                I graduated highschool in 1999, and against my parents wishes, I chose to venture out on my own and not pursue a tertiary education.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t until I had a family of my own that I could understand my mother's words from decades ago.
                So here I am, delving back into the books, not only to expand my knowledge, but to also set a positive example for my children, my future.</p>

        <div class="titleright"> Interest in IT
        </div>
        <div class="maincontent"> 
            <p>My interest in IT started with my first home computer and my introduction to the internet.  I was 15 at the time and my parents had commissioned my cousin’s boyfriend to build us a family PC and teach my sisters and I how to navigate its uses. As I’d always been fascinated with technology I was immediately drawn to the machine and would spend hours on end digging through the files and playing around with moving and editing them, trying to see how it’d affect the system. More often than not, this would result in my cousin’s boyfriend returning to fix my blunders. Fortunately, he was a very patient person, and would pass on bits and pieces of knowledge which I would go on to use even to this day.</p>
            <p>Over the years I’ve had to say farewell to some old friends like Ask Jeeves and mIRC, but I’ve been able to acquaint myself with new ones like Google and Discord. With each new platform, I’m brought back to that first moment of being a kid given a new toy to explore.

            <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
            <p> Upon deciding to study, my first step was to turn to Google. All the results, whether they be from professional websites, to personal tips in forums, required me to have a set field or career path in mind. My dilemma was that I hadn’t decided on a field because all of them were appealing and the more I delved into them the more I was curious about them. My reason was simply to study for knowledge.</p>
            <p id="it-job">My decision to go with RMIT was due to the student advisor’s advice. Instead of looking at specific short courses and units that focused purely on one particular field of IT, I should look at a course that offered a broader range of units that touched upon as many aspects of IT as possible. </p>
            <p>From this foundation unit, I plan to continue with the rest of the Bachelor of IT degree to gain not only the necessary skills for any IT field I find interesting, but also the knowledge to answer the age old question: <em>Why is the WIFI so slow?</em>

        <h3>Junior Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p> This IT company is looking for fresh graduates with experience in coding who are keen and willing to be mentored in a full stack developers role. This would involve learning both back and front end application of their business' software.  </p>

            <ul>    <li>Scripting Language - C, C#, C++, Node.Js</li>
                <li>Any JS Framework such as: React, Angular, Vue.js</li></ul>

            <p>These two test results perfectly sum up my personality and approach to life. My inquisitive nature to understand the inner workings of everything around me, whether it be machine, code, or people can at times create more trouble than its worth. My stubbornness and lack of knowledge in certain fields can be a volatile mix as I can lose myself in the process of reconstructing projects in order to understand their inner workings . Sometimes it pays off, but mostly I have to resort to ‘Googling’ for assistance. </p>
            <p>In a group setting, I enjoy listening and throwing out ideas. Once a plan is set, I’ll dive into the required tasks eagerly. Confrontation and leadership aren’t my strong points so I’ll gravitate towards members who are happy to take on those roles. </p>
