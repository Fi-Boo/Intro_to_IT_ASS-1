                <p>It was a dreary morning, the mist lay so heavily on the jungle floor that visibility beyond a few meters was impossible. The peaceful silence was broken by the muffled breathing of two shadows stealthily rushing through the foliage. Their destination, a small fishing boat anchored on a sandbank just off shore.<br> 
                <p>Once aboard, the couple were shuttled into the rear cabin alongside numerous other villagers. As the boatman raised anchor and pushed off, all eyes were plastered to the beach line, watching out for the telltale signs that their escape attempt had been discovered. </p>
                <p>Only once the beach had vanished behind the wall of impenetrable mist were they able to relax. At this point the young lady loosened her grip on a small bundle held firmly against her chest. Looking down she pulled back a corner of the wrapping cloth to reveal the face of a 16 day old infant.</p>

                <p>My name is Phi (or Phil) and I was that infant. Having escaped a war torn Vietnam, my family consisting of my parents, my sister and myself were fortunate enough to be granted Australian citizenship and settled in Richmond, Victoria. </p> 
                <p>Growing up in a traditional Vietnamese Catholic household was tough. Studying was ingrained into me from a young age with a plethora of after school academic activities like piano, english, mathematics and choir. 
                I graduated highschool in 1999, and against my parents wishes, I chose to venture out on my own and not pursue a tertiary education.</p>
                <p>Decades later, with a family of my own, I would reflect on the story told at every family gathering and my mother’s words would hit home. I finally understood why they risked their lives to escape to a foreign land and dedicate themselves to working endless hours to give us a chance at an education.
                So here I am, delving back into the books to finish what they started, and set a positive example for my future, my children.</p>

        <div class="titleright"> Interest in IT
        </div>
        <div class="maincontent"> 
            <p>My interest in IT started with my first home computer and my introduction to the internet. I was 15 at the time and my parents had commissioned my cousin’s boyfriend to build us a family PC and teach my sisters and I how to navigate its uses. As I’d always been fascinated with technology I was immediately drawn to the machine and would spend hours on end digging through the files and playing around with moving and editing them, trying to see how it’d affect the system. More often than not, this resulted in severe errors that required tech support. Fortunately, the boyfriend was a very patient person, and would pass on bits and pieces of knowledge which I would go on to use even to this day.</p>
            <p>From him, I discovered the world of PC gaming. From various 2d side scrolling games, to full blown triple AAA titles, I dived into all types to experience this other world of pixels. By this point I was capable enough with Ask Jeeves to research about hardware limitations and requirements such as CPU, GPU, RAM to further my understanding how they may affect my PC gaming experience. My understanding for PC hardware and interest in staying abreast of their development would continue on through life as I would take up building custom computers for friends and family.</p>
            <p>Even though IT played a major role throughout my personal life, I’d only awaken to how vast it truly was in my later years while working in the casino industry. As a sales executive, I was exposed to the various technologies and teams that were employed to advertise, and maintain the ‘Crown lifestyle’. I engaged with the graphics team who put together all the media content, on and off site. I had direct dealings with the front end developers who managed the website and interactive displays scattered throughout the complex. I’d often see the hardware tech  members scurry about like worker ants, resolving blue screens and PC issues on the gaming floor. The ‘specialist’ slot machine technicians whose sole purpose is to monitor the outputs for the slot machines. Even the gaming tables themselves were employed with high tech cameras and scanners to counter fraud. Then there were the mysterious back end developers who rarely left their den far below surface level. On the rare one may come up to enquire further about a task they were given.
            My mind was blown at how much IT was involved in so many different departments and fields within a business that thrived on selling a lifestyle.</p>
            <p>My interest was piqued and this would eventually lead me to studying IT.</p>
        
            <img class="studypic" src="css/lightbulb.png" alt="lightbulb moment">
            <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
            <p> Upon deciding to study, my first step was to turn to Google. All the results, whether they be from professional websites, to personal tips in forums, required me to have a set field or career path in mind. My dilemma was that I hadn’t decided on a field because all of them were appealing and the more I delved into them the more I was curious about them. My reason was simply to study for knowledge.</p>
            <p>My decision to go with RMIT was due to the student advisor’s advice. Instead of looking <str id="it-job"></str>at specific short courses and units that focused purely on one particular field of IT, I should look at a course that offered a broader range of units that touched upon as many aspects of IT as possible. </p>
            <p>From this foundation unit, I plan to continue with the rest of the Bachelor of IT degree to gain not only the necessary skills for any IT field I find interesting, but also the knowledge to answer the age old question: <em>Why is the WIFI so slow?</em>

        </h3>
            <p>This IT company is looking for fresh graduates with experience in coding who are keen and willing to be mentored in a full stack developers role. As a team member, the successful applicant will be trained in both front and back end operations for the business’ software offering.</p>
            <p>Firstly, this role is appealing because it requires no work experience. This means I don’t have to worry about learning one company’s way of handling a technology, only to have to relearn it because the next company does it differently. Having no experience means I can go into it with an inquisitive mind and ask without fearing that I should know the answer from past experiences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and most important is level of exposure I’d get to the whole process in the creation, development and maintenance of the company software. Being a ‘full stack’ position, I’d be taught to handle the back end framework and databases while also using front end languages to integrate these technologies into a complete software package for the user.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, being in a team where all members are equip to handle any aspect of a program would allow me to learn from anyone at anytime..</p>

        <p>To address the most important requirement, I’ve enrolled in a Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
            Though this degree will expose me to many of the technologies that can and will be used by full stack developers, I think its important to further study the specifics that would help me acquire the position.
        <p>Contacting the employer to find more information about how the frameworks and scripting languages are used would allow me to seek additional studies through short courses and webinars</p>

            <p>These two test results perfectly sum up my personality and approach to life. My inquisitive nature to understand the inner workings of everything around me, whether it be machine, code, or people can at times create more trouble than its worth. <str id="it-project"></str>My stubbornness and lack of knowledge in certain fields can be a volatile mix as I can lose myself in the process of reconstructing projects in order to understand their inner workings . Sometimes it pays off, but mostly I have to resort to ‘Googling’ for assistance. </p>
            <p>In a group setting, I enjoy listening and throwing out ideas. Once a plan is set, I’ll dive into the required tasks eagerly. Confrontation and leadership aren’t my strong points so I’ll gravitate towards members who are happy to take on those roles. </p>

        <div class="maincontent">
            <p>Whether we accept it or not, video games are a part of life. According to Statistica, over 80% of children aged 5 and above play them (Hughes, 2021). As such, it came to no surprise that my children would fall into the ‘gamer' pitfall as they aged. 
            So much so that they would rather spend time on their computers or ipads than with dad, me.</p> 
            <p>What better way to connect with them then through the creation of a video game. With a mix of educational elements and fast paced evasion and combat, I hope to keep them entertained and have fun while learning. </p>
            <p>Hopefully, this game will show them that anyone can create a video game, and hopefully spark their interest in not only playing games, but also creating them. </p>
            
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>As a gamer, I understand the appeal of the pixel world, but as a parent my concern is the impact videos games have on my children. As many of these games serve content and force feed them to my kids, their imagination and creativity is slowly sapped away.</p> 
            <p>Recent attempts at a verbal creativity game where we took turns adding a sentence to a story yielded horrifying results from my son. Beyond minecraft and roblox references, he was unable to imagine any interesting ideas for the story.</p>
            <p>In another attempt to reawaken their imagination, we started reading fantasy stories together. Along the way I’d ask them about specific scenes or creatures and have them draw or describe it in their own words. The results worried me as I’d compare them to my past self who grew up without these technologies.</p>
            <p>However, the exercise did draw interest from both kids and for a while we connected and started having fun with story time. But a few weeks on and they would lose interest mainly because <em>reading</em> was like studying and studying equals boring.</p>
            <h4>The idea</h4>
            <p>A video game to captivate and challenge the target audience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Bailey aka Mini-me aka (The Son)</li>
                <li> Ivy aka Mini-boss aka (The Daughter)</li>
                <li> Probably the neighbours kids and anyone else who might be interested</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The layout</h4>
            <p>The game incorporate both 2D top down and side scrolling.
            <ul>
                <li>Top down view will be used in the larger school map where the user returns frequently as they travel around to the different buildings to combat the classroom bosses. </li>
                <li>Side scrolling view will be used for theschool buildings that lead to classrooms as these buildings will incorporate multiple levels, gravity will come into play.</li>
                <li>Classroom boss, or in this case Teacher, encounters can be either top down or side scrolling. This is dependant on the specific encounter.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p>The user plays a student whose sole purpose is to navigate the school grounds and various school buildings to combat and defeat the boss level teachers. Along the way, they will encounter various NPC that fall under the following categories: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendly</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>offers clues and tips to class and teacher encounters</li>
                        <li>restores health in the form of a hug</li>
                        <li>grants stats boosts temporarily</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Neutral</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>gives random educational tips that may or may not be helpful to encounters</li>
                        <li>offers advice on dating?</li>
                        <li>random gibberish</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Aggressive - School Bullies and angry wildlife</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>will hurt you</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Aggressive NPC can be combated by moving away exiting their aggression range, or giving them a good stomping (Kids are not encouraged to do this IRL).</p>
            Navigation of school buildings will require the user to avoid obstacles which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ground obstacles that move across the ground - avoided by jumping over them</li>
                <li>patrolling obstacles like bullies - these have a set patrol pathway and can be avoided by jumping or stomping</li>
                <li>ranged obstacles like spitballs - these can come from various angles and can only be avoided by movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Within these school buildings are the classrooms occupied by boss level teachers. Each encounter will be different and require the use of both knowledge in a specific subject and hand eye coordination to defeat and pass the class.</p>

            <p>For hardware, a computer running windows 7 or later with a dx10 capable GPU will be used to create and edit the project.</p>
            <p>The two main tools employed are the unity engine via the Unity editing software, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
            <p>The Unity editing software will be the primary tool to create and edit the game via code. A visual scripting mod such as Playmaker or Adventure Creator will be used to reduce coding requirements by allowing some of the elements to be handled via a visual point and click system user interface.</p>
            <p>Adobe Photoshop will be used to create or edit the artwork and in game textures and skins.</p>
            <p>For audio tracks and in game sound effects, ‘Google’ will be the place to begin. There are a multitude of free and paid sound effect websites. The hardest part will be trying to find the right sound to accommodate the feel of the game.</p>
            <h3>Skills required</h3>
            <p>The technical skill requirement is a thorough understanding of the C# programming language as this is the program’s native language. However, through the use of scripts,  other .Net languages such as C++ can also be used.</p>
            <p>Motivation and the willingness to face and overcome challenges are a must as there will be many hurdles during development, from the creative aspects like story boarding, character design, combat implementations, to the technical aspects like learning the coding and researching educational material to be used in game.  </p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The ideal outcome would be my children enjoying the video game I’ve created. I hope they find it challenging enough to replay and challenge the records if they succeed, yet not quit if they fail. Understanding where they failed and taking the necessary steps to overcome these failures is an important part of life.</p>
            <p>Through problem solving together, they will hopefully learn the importance of social interaction and team work.</p>
            <p>The biggest gain would come from them realising that an imagination and a personal drive to create and challenge life will open new opportunities. Playing other peoples games is great for inspiration but creating and playing your own is always better. Isn't life just an ongoing game of adventure and discovery filled with challenges?</p>
